# Circle-vs-Rectangle-Collision-Response-Java
Circle-to-rectangle collision response algorithm.

This project requires viewers to have an understanding of simple rectangle vs rectangle collision detection and response; Circle vs Circle collision detection and response; and Circle vs Rectangle collision detection. Go to this playlist to watch my collision detection/response tutorials using Java:

The algorithms that are implemented here only work with axis-aligned rectangle, in other words, a rectangle that is not rotated. This project is explained in this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be0WANYMH_k

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes and doesn't contain circle-to-rectangle collision response algorithm. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
